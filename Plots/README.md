We store the plots generated by the main.py in this folder. The folder **Article** contains the plots we show in the article. 

We show plots for three metrics:
* The folder **Rewards** contains the rewards the different agent obtained
* The folder **AgentPolicy** contains the plots of the difference between the agent policy and the optimal policy
* The folder **OptimalPolicy** contains the plots of the difference between the best policy computed on the model the agent learned and the optimal policy.
